# Description
`serum` is a fresh take on Dependency Injection in Python 3.

`serum` is pure python, has no dependencies, and is less than 300 lines of code.
# Installation
```
> pip install serum
```
# Quickstart
```python
from serum import inject, Component, Environment, abstractmethod, mock


# Components can be abstract 
class AbstractLog(Component):
    @abstractmethod
    def info(self, message: str):
        pass


# ...And concrete
class SimpleLog(AbstractLog):
    def info(self, message: str):
        print(message)


class StubLog(SimpleLog):
    def info(self, message: str):
        pass


class NeedsLog:
    # Components can be injected
    log = inject(AbstractLog)

    
class NeedsSimpleLog:
    log = inject(SimpleLog)


# Components can't be injected outside an environment
NeedsLog().log.info('Hello serum!')  # raises: NoEnvironment

with Environment():
    # Abstract components can only be injected in environments
    # that provide concrete implementations
    NeedsLog().log.info('Hello serum!')  # raises: UnregisteredDependency
    # Concrete components can be injected even in an
    # empty environment
    NeedsSimpleLog().log.info('Hello serum!') # outputs: Hello serum!

with Environment(SimpleLog):
    NeedsLog().log.info('Hello serum!')  # outputs: Hello serum!

# Environments will always provide the most specific 
# subtype of the requested type
with Environment(SimpleLog, StubLog):
    NeedsLog().log.info('Hello serum!')  # doesn't output anything
    NeedsSimpleLog().log.info('Hello serum!')  # doesn't output anything

with Environment(SimpleLog):
    # mock is a helper method for mocking components
    mock_log = mock(AbstractLog)
    mock_log.info.return_value = 'Mocked!'
    assert NeedsLog().log is mock_log
    assert NeedsLog().log.info('') == 'Mocked!'
```

## `Component`
`Component`s are dependencies that can be injected.
```python
from serum import Component, Environment, inject

class Log(Component):
    def info(self, message):
        print(message)

class NeedsLog:
    log = inject(Log)

instance = NeedsLog()
with Environment():
    assert isinstance(instance.log, Log)
```
`Component`s can only define an `__init__` method that takes 1 parameter.
```python
class ValidComponent(Component):  # OK!
    some_dependency = inject(SomeDependency)
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = self.some_dependency.method()

class InvalidComponent(Component):  # raises: InvalidComponent: __init__ method in Components can only take 1 parameter
    def __init__(self, a):
        self.a = a
```
To construct `Component`s with dependencies, you should instead use `inject`
```python

class ComponentWithDependencies(Component):
    log = inject(Log)
```
Note that if you access injected members in the constructor of any type,
that type can only be instantiated inside an environment (see [`Environment`](#environment)).

Also note that circular dependencies preventing component instantiation leads to
an error.
```python
class AbstractA(Component):
    pass

class AbstractB(Component):
    pass

class A(AbstractA):
    b = inject(AbstractB)

    def __init__(self):
        self.b

class B(AbstractB):
    a = inject(AbstractA)
    def __init__(self):
        self.a

class Dependent:
    a = inject(AbstractA)

with Environment(A, B):
    Dependent().a  # raises: CircularDependency: Circular dependency encountered while injecting <class 'AbstractA'> in <B object at 0x1061e3898>
```
`Component`s can be abstract. Abstract `Component`s can only be injected in an
`Environment` that provides a concrete implementation. For convenience you can import
`abstractmethod`, `abstractclassmethod` or `abstractclassmethod` from `serum`,
but they simply refer to the decorators from the `abc` module 
in the standard library.
```python
from serum import abstractmethod

class AbstractLog(Component):
    @abstractmethod
    def info(self, message):
        pass
        
class NeedsLog:
    log = inject(AbstractLog)

instance = NeedsLog()
with Environment():
    instance.log  # raises UnregisteredDependency: No concrete implementation of <class 'AbstractLog'> found

class ConcreteLog(AbstractLog):
    def info(self, message):
        print(message)

with Environment(ConcreteLog):
    instance.log  # Ok!
 
```
## `Environment`
`Environment`s provide implementations of `Components`. An `Environment` will always provide the most
specific subtype of the requested type (in Method Resolution Order).
```python
class Super(component):
    pass


class Sub(Super):
    pass


class NeedsSuper:
    instance = inject(Super)


with Environment(Sub):
    assert isinstance(NeedsSuper().instance, Sub)
```
It is an error to inject a type in an `Environment` that provides two or more equally specific subtypes of that type:
```python
class AlsoSub(Super):
    pass


with Environment(Sub, AlsoSub):
    NeedsSuper().instance  # raises: AmbiguousDependencies: Attempt to inject type <class 'Log'> with equally specific provided subtypes: <class 'MockLog'>, <class 'FileLog'>
```
`Environment`s can also be used as decorators:
```python
test_environment = Environment(Sub)

@test_environment
def f():
    assert isinstance(NeedsSuper().instance, Sub)

```
You can only provide subtypes of `Component` with `Environment`.
```python
class C:
    pass

Environment(C)  # raises: InvalidDependency: Attempt to register type that is not a Component: <class 'C'> 
```
`Environment`s are local to each thread. This means that when using multi-threading
each thread must define its own environment.
```python
import threading

def worker_without_environment():
    NeedsSuper().instance  # raises NoEnvironment: Can't inject components outside an environment

def worker_with_environment():
    with Environment(Sub):
        NeedsSuper().instance  # OK!

with Environment():
    threading.Thread(target=worker_without_environment()).start()
    threading.Thread(target=worker_with_environment()).start()
```
## `inject`
Just as you can only provide subtypes of `Component` with `Environment`, 
you can only inject subtypes of `Component`.
```python
class NotAComponent:
    pass
    

class InvalidDependent:
    dependency = inject(NotAComponent)  # raises: InvalidDependency: Attempt to inject type that is not a Component: <class 'C'>
```
Injected `Component`s can't be accessed outside an `Environment` context:
```python
class Dependency(Component):
    pass


class Dependent:
    dependency = inject(Dependency)


Dependent().dependency  # raises NoEnvironment: Can't inject components outside an environment 
```
Injected `Component`s are immutable
```python
with Environment():
    Dependent().dependency = 'mutate this'  # raises AttributeError: Can't set property
```
An injected member of an instance will always refer to the same component 
instance. Injected members of different instances will refer to different
component instances
```python
with Environment():
    instance1 = NeedsLog()
    assert instance1.log is instance1.log
    instance2 = NeedsLog()
    assert instance2.log is not instance1.log
``` 
## `Singleton`
To always inject the same instance of a component, inherit from `Singleton`.
```python
from serum import Singleton

class ExpensiveObject(Singleton):
    pass

class NeedsExpensiveObject:
    expensive_instance = inject(ExpensiveObject)

with Environment():
    instance1 = NeedsExpensiveObject()
    instance2 = NeedsExpensiveObject()
    assert instance1.expensive_instance is instance2.expensive_instance
```
## `immutable`
If you want to define immutable members (constants) in components (or any other classes), 
`serum` provides the `immutable` utility
that also supports type inference with PEP 484 tools. 
```python
from serum import immutable

class Immutable:
    value = immutable(1)

i = Immutable()
i.value = 2  # raises AttributeError: Can't set property
```
This is just convenience for:
```python
class Immutable:
    value = property(fget=lambda _: 1)
```
## `mock`
`serum` has support for injecting `MagicMock`s from the builtin
`unittest.mock` library in unittests using the `mock` utility
function. `mock` is only usable inside an an environment context. Mocks are reset
when the environment context is closed.
```python
from serum import mock


class Dependency(Component):
    def method(self):
        return 'some value' 

class Dependent:
    dependency = inject(Dependency)

environment = Environment()
with environment:
    mock_dependency = mock(Dependency)
    mock_dependency.method.return_value = 'some mocked value'
    instance = Dependent()
    assert instance.dependency is mock_dependency
    assert instance.dependency.method() == 'some mocked value'

with environment:
    instance = Dependent()
    assert instance.dependency is not mock_dependency
    assert isinstance(instance.dependency, Dependency)

mock(Dependency)  # raises: NoEnvironment: Can't register mock outside environment
```
`mock` uses its argument to spec the injected instance of `MagicMock`. This means
that attempting to call methods that are not defined by the mocked `Component`
leads to an error
```python
with environment:
    mock_dependency = mock(Dependency)
    mock_dependency.no_method()  # raises: AttributeError: Mock object has no attribute 'no method'
```
Note that `mock` will only mock requests of the
exact type supplied as its argument, but not requests of
more or less specific types
```python
from unittest.mock import MagicMock


class Super(Component):
    pass


class Sub(Super):
    pass


class SubSub(Sub):
    pass


class NeedsSuper:
    injected = inject(Super)


class NeedsSub:
    injected = inject(Sub)


class NeedsSubSub:
    injected = inject(SubSub)


with Environment():
    mock(Sub)
    needs_super = NeedsSuper()
    needs_sub = NeedsSub()
    needs_subsub = NeedsSubSub()
    assert isinstance(needs_super.injected, Super)
    assert isinstance(needs_sub.injected, MagicMock)
    assert isinstance(needs_subsub.injected, SubSub)
```
## PEP 484
`serum` is designed for type inference with PEP 484 tools (work in progress). 
This feature is currently only supported for the PyCharm type checker.

# Why?
If you've been researching Dependency Injection frameworks for python,
you've no doubt come across this opinion:

>You dont need Dependency Injection in python. 
>You can just use duck typing and monkey patching!
 
The position behind this statement is often that you only need Dependency 
Injection in statically typed languages.

In truth, you don't really _need_ Dependency Injection in any language, 
statically typed or otherwise. 
When building large applications that need to run in multiple environments however,
Dependency Injection can make your life a lot easier. In my experience,
excessive use of monkey patching for managing environments leads to a jumbled
mess of implicit initialisation steps and `if value is None` type code.

In addition to being a framework, I've attempted to design `serum` to encourage
designing classes that follow the Dependency Inversion Principle:

> one should “depend upon abstractions, _not_ concretions."

This is achieved by letting inheritance being the principle way of providing
dependencies and allowing dependencies to be abstract. See the `example.py` for a
detailed tutorial (work in progress).
